## Files description
1. audio_DNN_feature.ipynb- Code to extract features for Audio DNN model. For each audio file (or face video), a feature of dimension 1582 is stored in .npy file.
2. audio_LSTM_feature.ipynb- Code to extract features for Audio LSTM models. Each audio input is broken into 76 chunks with an overlap of 50ms. 
3. audio_DNN.ipynb- Code to train Audio_DNN model.
4. audio_LSTM1.ipynb- Code to train Audio LSTM models (Fixed number of the chunks)
5. audio_LSTM2.ipynb- Code to train Audio LSTM models (Fixed size of a audio chunk)
